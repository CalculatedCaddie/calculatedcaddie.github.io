Honestly, I don't even know where to begin. I have just started to really try and dable into website design and creation. Most of my coding experience is with programming in python. I am open to learning other languages or branching out on my own to learn snippets of information that I will need to help me code better.

{% highlight ruby %}
def printname(name):
  print(f'Hi! My name is {name}...')


def main():
  name = input('Please enter your name: ')
  printname(name)

if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
{% endhighlight %}
